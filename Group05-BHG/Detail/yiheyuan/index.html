                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>In the first year of the Zhen Yuan Dynasty (1153), the gold owner Wanyan Liang set up Jinshan Palace here. After the Yuan Dynasty established Beijing as its capital, Guo Shoujing, a water scientist, opened up the upstream water source to meet the water needs of the grain transport. He diverted the sacred mountain spring of Baifu village in Changping and the running water along the way into the lake, which increased the water potential and became a reservoir to guarantee the water supply for the palace and to receive the grain transport.
				<br><br>
				Hongzhi Ming Dynasty seven years (1494), the Ming Xiao Zong nursing mother to help the saint of Mrs. Luo in the urn mountain before the building of the Jingyuan Temple, after the waste. Thereafter, the gardens around Wurn Mountain gradually increased. Ming Wusong built a palace on the lakeside, called "good mountain garden", for the royal garden. Emperor Wusong of the Ming Dynasty and Emperor Shenzong of the Ming Dynasty used to go boating here for pleasure. During the reign of Emperor Mingxi, Wei Zhongxian had claimed the good mountain garden as his own.
				<br><br>
				In the early years of Qianlong in the Qing Dynasty, the number of gardens in the Haidian area in the western suburbs of Beijing increased, and the large amount of water used for gardens increased with each passing day. At that time, in addition to the Wanquan River system, which had a smaller flow, most of the water used for gardens came from the source of Yuquan Mountain and flowed into the West Lake, which was also the water source of Tonghui River since the Ming Dynasty. Qianlong fifteen years (1750), in preparation for worship queen celebrates queen (xiao SAN xian) 60th birthday, qianlong emperor ordered the company to dig for governance jingxi drainage for reason of west lake, intercept, xishan, yuquan hill, ShouAnShan water and high water lake in the west of the west lake excavation and raising water lake, to the sanhu as reservoir, guarantee the palace garden with water, and irrigation water for farmland around. Emperor Qianlong changed the name of West Lake to Kunming Lake in reference to Emperor Wudi of the Han Dynasty who dug Kunming Pool to drill the water army. The earthwork of digging the lake was piled up on Wengshan in Hubei Province, which was renamed Wanshou Hill.

				<h3>	Suzhou Street, also known as "Trading Street", is built on both sides of the rear lake in imitation of Jiangnan water town. During the time of the Garden of Clear Ripples, there were all kinds of shops on the shore, such as jade antique shops, silk shops, dim sum shops, teahouses, gold and silver jewelry shops and so on. Shop assistants are eunuchs, maids dress up. The emperor began "business" when he traveled. Dozens of shops on the shore of the back lake were burned down by the foreign powers in the tenth year of Xianfeng (1860) and rebuilt in 1986.
