				<h3></h3>
                <p>The Old Summer Palace is a large imperial garden in the Qing Dynasty. It is located in Haidian District, Beijing. It was first built in 1707 (the 46th year of the reign of Emperor Kangxi), which was composed of the Old Summer Palace and its subsidiary gardens Changchun and Qichun (later renamed Wanchun Garden). Qing emperor would come here every summer to stay away from the heat and listen to government, so the Yuanmingyuan is also called "Summer Palace". In 1860, during the Second Opium War, the Old Summer Palace was ransacked and burned by the British and French allied forces. The site is now the Old Summer Palace Ruins Park

                <p>The chief designer of the Yuanmingyuan was Lei Jinyu, who had been chosen by Kangxi for the construction of the Forbidden City, but the actual construction was largely the opinion of the emperor, with Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong all directing it personally. And created the "hot sample" model method. It was destroyed during the reign of Xianfeng.
				<br><br>
				The name Yuanmingyuan was given by Emperor Kangxi. Kangxi emperor imperial calligraphy three characters board, hanging on the Yuanming Hall above the door. Emperor Yongzheng had an explanation for this "Yuanming", saying that the meaning of the word "Yuanming" is: round and absorbed in the spirit, the gentleman's time is also; The wisdom of a man is illumined by the brightness of the world. "Round" means a person's moral integrity is complete and beyond ordinary people. "Bright" means that political achievements are bright and wise. This can be said to be the ruling class in feudal times flaunt the ideal standard of the Ming, the king and the virtuous.
				<br><br>
				After Emperor Qianlong ascended the throne, he adjusted the landscape of the garden and added building groups, and built Changchun Garden and Qichun Garden (renamed Wanchun Garden during the reign of Emperor Tongzhi) in the east and southeast of the garden. These three gardens, under the management of the Yuanmingyuan minister, called Yuanmingyuan three gardens.
				<br><br>
				On October 6, 1860, British and French troops set fire to the Old Summer Palace. Emperor Tongzhi tried to repair it, but was forced to stop because of financial difficulties. After the Eight-Power Allied Forces, the Old Summer Palace was destroyed by warlords and attacked by bandits, and eventually became a ruin.
