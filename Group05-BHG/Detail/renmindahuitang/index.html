                <h2>Introduction</h2>
				<h3></h3>
                <p>In 1956, China completed its first five-year plan ahead of schedule. The living standards of the people have been greatly improved, especially the spiritual outlook of the people of the whole country has also undergone profound changes. 
				<br>The Communist Party of China has a very high prestige in the minds of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and the broad masses of people long to hear the voice of the Party Central Committee directly. Thus, from 1956, they were planning to build a large auditorium in Beijing for the use of the Central Committee of the Party.</p>

                <h3>Main scenes</h3>
                <p>The East Gate is the main gate of the Great Hall of the People and the entrance to the Great Hall of Ten Thousand People. There is a huge national emblem hanging above the golden bronze doors. The open square in front of the gate is also the place for welcoming state guests and inspecting the guards of honor of the armed forces.
				<br><br>
				Enter the Great Hall of the People from the East Gate, and pass through the Foyer and Lounge to the Central Hall. The central hall covers an area of 3,600 square meters. The parapet and ground are paved with colored marble, surrounded by 20 white marble pillars. The middle level has a 12-meter-wide cloister, and six main doors leading to the auditorium for 10,000 people.<br><br>
				The Maoer Lane in South Luogu Lane was named for the hat-making workshop in the Qing Dynasty.
				 Maoer Lane was the residence of the last Empress Wanrong before her wedding, commonly known as the "Empress's Mansion."The most famous official office in history was the Yamen in the No.
				 45 Yard of Maoer Lane, which was called "North Yamen" by the old Beijingers.
				<br><br>
				The main southern part of the Great Hall of the People is the office building of the NPC Standing Committee. There is a national reception hall in the center of the first floor, which is the place where the state leaders receive the distinguished guests and the president receives the credentials presented by the new foreign ambassadors to China, covering an area of 550 square meters. The design is rich in ethnic traditional style. The top model is a chessboard caisson, hanging 4 palace lamp crystal chandeliers. Around the walls decorated with brocade soft bags. On the main wall is a symbol of the five thousand years of Chinese civilization of the huge painting "up and down the river Â· vast Changchun".
				<br><br>
				The central hall on the third floor of the Great Hall of the People is also known as the "Golden Hall". Not much is known about the Golden Hall, which is usually closed to the general public. This is the hall where Party and state leaders hold the country's top press conferences, and a "window" for major political and economic policy developments in China. Can say, this only 1000 square metre "window", witnessed the development process of our country. Every year when the NPC and CPPCC sessions are held, the premier's press conference is usually arranged in the "Golden Hall", which becomes the focus of attention from home and abroad.</p>
