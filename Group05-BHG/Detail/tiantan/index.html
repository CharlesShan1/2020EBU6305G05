                <h2>The temple of Heaven Park</h2>
                <h3>Building Style</h3>
                <p>The temple of Heaven Park is a place where emperors of Ming and Qing Dynasties worship heaven and pray for a bumper harvest of grain every year. The temple of heaven is famous for its rigorous architectural layout, peculiar architectural structure and magnificent architectural decoration. It covers an area of about 2.7 million square meters and is divided into inner altar and outer altar. The main buildings are the inner altar, the round dome altar and the imperial vault in the south, the prayer hall and the Huangqian hall in the north. The two groups of buildings are connected by a corridor connecting the north and the South - Danbi bridge. The outer altar is full of ancient cypresses, which surround the inner altar, making the main buildings more solemn and grand. There are also echo wall, three tone stone, dialogue stone, etc. built by skillful use of acoustic principle in the altar, which fully shows the developed level of ancient Chinese architectural technology. The temple of Heaven Park is the largest preserved altar complex in China.
				<br><br>
				The temple of heaven has two walls, forming the inner and outer altars, which are round in the north and round in the south. At the beginning, in order to show the image of heaven and earth on the wall, to symbolize the saying that "the sky is round and the place is round". There were no doors on the southeast and north sides of the outer altar wall, only Yongdingmen in the west, and two doors on the inner street: the north gate was an old one in the Ming Dynasty, which was called "qigutan gate"; The south gate was added in 1752, the 17th year of Qianlong reign, and it is called "the gate of Yuanqiu altar". The two doors are of three arched style, with green glazed tiles and Hill Style roofs. Both the north gate and the east gate of Waitan were built after 1975. There is also an east-west partition wall in the middle of the inner altar, which can be regarded as the north wall of the round hill altar. This section of partition wall protrudes to the north in an arc at the two axes, bypasses the outer wall of the imperial vault and connects with the wall of the East and West Inner altar, dividing the two altars of Qigu and Huanqiu into two areas.
