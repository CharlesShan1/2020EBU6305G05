				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<h3></h3>
				<p>The National Stadium (Bird's Nest) is located in the southern part of the central area of Beijing Olympic Green. It is the main stadium for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. It covers an area of 20.4 hectares, with a floor area of 258,000 square meters, and can accommodate 91,000 spectators. The opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympic and Paralympic Games were held, as well as athletics and football finals. After the Olympic Games, it has become a large professional venue for Beijing citizens to participate in sports activities and enjoy sports entertainment, as well as a landmark sports building and the Olympic legacy.

                <h2>Beijing National Stadium</h2>
                <h3>Structure</h3>
                <p>The geometry of the plinth and the stadium merge into one, like roots and trees. Pedestrians walk along a gentle grid of stone footpaths that continue the structure of the stadium. The Spaces between the walkways provide services for stadium guests: sunken gardens, stone-paved plazas, bamboo groves, mineral-like mountain views, and openings to the interior of the plinth. Rising slowly from the city's floor, the stadium's base is formed almost imperceptibly. The entrance to the stadium has a slightly elevated floor, allowing for a panoramic view of the entire Olympic Park complex.
				<br><br>
				The space effect of the stadium is novel and radical, but simple and simple. The appearance of the stadium is purely structural, the facade and the structure are unified. The various structural elements support each other and come together in a grid, as if woven, to integrate the building's facade, stairs, bowl-shaped bleachers and roof into one whole. To make the roof waterproof, the gaps between the stadium structures will be filled with light-permeating membranes, just as birds add soft fillings between their twig-woven nests. Since all the facilities - restaurant, guest room, shop and toilet - are individually controlled units, the overall closure of the building facade is unnecessary. This allows the stadium to have natural ventilation, which is one of the most important aspects of the stadium's environmental design.
				<br><br>
				Comfortable and luxurious decoration, high quality and thoughtful supporting services, and a clear and good view are the guarantee of the quality of the box in the National Stadium. It not only provides a best place to watch the games in person, but also builds a social platform for social enterprises and celebrities from all walks of life to communicate, public relations and thank customers, providing a rare opportunity for enterprises to show their own strength and distinguished status. The box at the National Stadium is located on the fourth floor of the stadium. The number of boxes after the match is 140 after the renovation.

					The hoisting of the main roof truss and the installation of the facade secondary structure have been fully carried out. The Bird's Nest structure is made of steel up to 11cm thick and has never before been produced in China. In addition, the "nest" on the top of the lattice structure will be covered with a translucent film. Using this film, the light in the stadium is not directly coming in, but through diffuse reflection, so that the light is softer, the resulting diffuse light can also solve the lawn maintenance problems, but also for the seat shelter function.
